# KK8 Bangladesh — SEO Site — `kk8bd.site`

Primary commercial property in the KK8 Bangladesh two-site brand SEO campaign.
Static HTML, Bengali content, deployed on GitHub Pages behind Cloudflare.

**Search intent this property owns:** navigational + transactional (kk8, kk8 login, kk8 register, kk8 app, kk8 casino, kk8 deposit).
It must NOT compete with `kk8bd.news` on the same intent — that is what keeps both
properties on page one instead of one filtering the other.

## How to edit this site

### The short version

Every page in the repo root (`index.html`, `kk8-review.html`, …) is plain HTML.
**You can open any of them in a text editor, change the words, save, and the live
site updates when you push.** Nothing has to be compiled to change text.

### The proper version

Root HTML files are *generated*. If you edit them directly, your change is
overwritten the next time someone runs a build. To make a change that lasts, edit
the source instead:

| To change… | Edit this |
|---|---|
| Page text | `pages/<slug>.html` |
| Header, footer, shared blocks | `partials/` |
| Titles, meta descriptions, H1s | `pages.json` |
| Domain, CTA link, licence, payment methods, providers | `site.config.json` |
| Colours, fonts, spacing | `tailwind.config.js` |
| Component styling | `src/input.css` |

Then rebuild:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Two languages — Bengali and English

Every page exists twice. Bengali is the default and keeps the root addresses
(`/login.html`); English lives under `/en/` (`/en/login.html`). Each pair points
at the other with hreflang (`bn-BD` / `en-BD`, `x-default` = Bengali), and the
flag switcher in the header links each page to its twin.

| What | Bengali | English |
|---|---|---|
| Page body | `pages/<slug>.html` | `pages/en/<slug>.html` |
| Title, H1, meta | `pages.json` → the page | `pages.json` → the page's `"en"` object |
| Header, footer, shells… | `partials/<name>.html` | `partials/en/<name>.html` |
| Config text | `labelBn`, `taglineBn`, `alt`… | `labelEn`, `taglineEn`, `altEn`… |
| Links inside a page | `/login.html` | `/en/login.html` |

**Edit both.** A fact changed in one language must be changed in the other —
the client reads both. A page only builds in English when it has both an `"en"`
entry and `pages/en/<slug>.html`; until then the switcher simply doesn't offer it.

### Changing the money-site link everywhere

The register/login/deposit buttons all point at one value. Open
`site.config.json`, change `moneySite`, run `npm run build`. Every page updates.
**This is the one edit to make when KK8 finalises the Bangladesh site.**

## Build requirements

Node 18+ and npm. First time only:

```bash
npm install
```

Then `npm run build` (HTML + CSS), or `npm run watch` while styling.

The site is static: once built, it needs no Node, no server and no database.
GitHub Pages serves the repo root directly.

---

## The build will refuse to publish broken SEO

`npm run build` runs thirteen validation gates and **fails with a non-zero exit**
if any page breaks one. This is deliberate — it is cheaper to fail a build than
to publish a page that quietly loses its ranking. Numbers match the build's
error messages.

1. Exactly one `<h1>`, containing `KK8`; the Latin primary keyword appears in the
   page text (BD players type Latin)
2. Title + meta description present, unique site-wide, carrying a geo token
3. Canonical present and on the configured domain
4. All JSON-LD parses; every declared schema type is emitted
5. Every image has non-empty Bengali alt text
6. No internal link points at a page that isn't in `pages.json`
7. `lang="bn"`; hreflang self-referencing only, never cross-domain
8. No body paragraph is duplicated on the sister property
9. No MYR/RM figures, no Malaysian payment rails, no Bangladesh legality claim
10. No primary keyword is targeted twice — on this site or across both sites
11. Structural tags (`div`, `section`, `button`, `a`, `p`, …) open and close in balance
12. Exactly one robots meta, matching the launch switch below
13. An English page carries no Bengali text (outside the language switcher's "বাংলা" link)

Gate 6 also fails when a page links into the other language anywhere except the
language switcher — an English page linking to `/login.html` instead of
`/en/login.html` is an untranslated link.

If a gate fails it names the page and the rule. Fix the source, rebuild.

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Never state or imply that gambling is legal in Bangladesh.** Gate 9 blocks the
  obvious phrasings, but it cannot catch every wording. Don't try.
- **Never invent a number.** Bonus amounts, minimum deposits, processing times,
  licence details, player counts. If it isn't published on KK8's official
  platform, it does not go on the page. Gate 9 catches currency leaks, not
  invented BDT figures — that one is on the writer.
- **Never copy text from the clone sites** (`kk8.run`, `kk8bd.net`) or from the
  sister property.
- **Keep the 18+ signal and the Kaan Pete Roi helpline in the footer.**
- **Re-verify facts before each publish.** Update `lastVerified` in
  `site.config.json` when you do; it renders as the "সর্বশেষ যাচাই" stamp.

## Deploying

```bash
npm run build
git add -A && git commit -m "content: <what changed>"
git push
```

GitHub Pages serves `main`. `CNAME` holds `kk8bd.site` — do not delete it, or the
custom domain unbinds.

### Launch switch — `"indexing"` in `site.config.json`

- `false` — **preview.** Every page carries `noindex,nofollow` and `robots.txt`
  names no sitemap. The site is reachable at its real address for review, but
  Google will not list it. The build prints `⚠ PREVIEW MODE` as a reminder.
- `true` — **live.** Pages are indexable and `robots.txt` points at the sitemap.

To launch: set it to `true`, `npm run build`, commit, push. Then in Google Search
Console submit `sitemap.xml` and request indexing for the homepage, login and
register pages first. Do not submit the sitemap while the switch is `false` — every
URL would be reported as "Submitted URL marked noindex".

`robots.txt` stays `Allow: /` in both modes on purpose: Google has to be able to
fetch a page to see its `noindex`.

### Missing pages and old addresses

- `404.html` is generated from `partials/404.html`. GitHub Pages shows it for any
  address that does not exist. It is always `noindex`.
- `"redirects"` in `site.config.json` maps an old address to a page on this site,
  e.g. `"/kk8-register/": "/register.html"`. The build writes a small forwarding
  page at each old address (GitHub Pages cannot send a server 301; an instant
  meta refresh is read by Google as a permanent redirect). Use the `/folder/`
  form. The build fails if the target is not a page in `pages.json`.
- Removing an entry does not delete its folder — delete the folder by hand.

## Rollback

Every build is a commit, so every version is recoverable:

```bash
git log --oneline          # find the good commit
git revert <commit>        # undo one commit, keeping history
git push
```

To preview an old version without publishing it:
`git checkout <commit>`, look, then `git checkout main`.
